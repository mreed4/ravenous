This is technically a guided Codecademy project to use React, props, and the Yelp API. 

However, by this point in my learning journey I have already learned some basic React and API manipulation principles in the building of other personal projects.

Further, while this project is based on using React class components, I have learned enough about React function components to essentially rewrite the app using the latter, as I go through the steps in the project. I am also using context, where the project I believe wants the student to use props, including passing them down to child components, etc.

Personally, I believe function components are more elegant, and I prefer to use context rather than having logic in some/all components.
